<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p1>We aren't really reinventing the wheel. We were always taught that a little hard work could go a long way. After helping our neighbors in the surrounding area for about a year, we not only realized how rewarding it is to help the community but also discovered that it pays better than our day jobs. So, we decided to take a leap of faith and quit our jobs. Since then, College Dudes Doin' Moves has been the ride of our lives, and we continue to count our blessings.

    Support your local college students - We love to get down and dirty ;)
